\section{Dataset}

For the given text-prediction problem, The Count of Monte Cristo has been chosen for creating the training dataset. Since the model is developed as a character-by-character predictor, we are interested in analyzing the source content at the character-level.

The book contains a total of about 2.65 million characters. The number of unique characters is 107: most of them are English letters and punctuation, but also numbers and Greek letters are present. Displayable characters are shown below.

\begin{verbatim}
	\n	 !	 "	 #	 $	 %	 &	 ""	 (	 )	 *	 		 -	 .	 /	 
	0	 1	 2	 3	 4	 5	 6	 7	 8	 9	 :	 ;	 ?	 @	 [	 ]	 _	 
	a	 b	 c	 d	 e	 f	 g	 h	 i	 j	 k	 l	 m	 n	 o	 p	 q	 r	 s	 t	 u	 v	 w	 x	 y	 z	 
	à	 â	 æ	 ç	 è	 é	 ê	 ë	 í	 î	 ï	 ô	 ü	 œ	 α	 δ	 ε	 ζ	 η	 κ	 μ	 ν	 π	 ρ	 ς	 
	%	σ	 τ	 υ	 —	 ‘	 ’	 "	 ”	 †
\end{verbatim}

These are distributed according to the figure \ref{fig:distr-chars}, from which it can be easily seen that the middle characters, the English letters, are the most prevalent ones together with the space character (the first one in the chart). On the other side, the second figure focus on showing how alphabetic-only characters (a-z) are distributed. For plotting both distributions and for all next computations, the entire book has been previously lowercased.

The machine learning dataset has been built by dividing the original text into batches composed by 16 sub-sequences, each 256 characters long. Doing so, a total of 647 batches has been obtained. The training set is composed of all the characters which appear ordered inside the book; the target of each character is the immediately following one, used to actually learning probabilistic sequences generation during the training phase.



\section{Training}

Training has been done using two LSTM cells of 256 units each, through 5 epochs with a learning rate of $10^{-2}$. Figure \ref{fig:loss-total} documents the evolution of the training loss (value on the y-axis) with respect to the epochs (x-axis). Starting from a loss of around 4.67, the fifth epoch reaches a loss that is around 1.30.

In the chart, it can be easily seen that the main improvement is done during the first two epochs, while the next ones are mainly useful for refining the predictions. Figure \ref{fig:loss-epochs} further visualizes this phenomenon: first epoch reaches a loss of about 1.80, improved at 1.50 by the second epoch and decreased to 1.3 during the next three epochs.

\end{figure}




\section{Text generation}

After the training has finished, several sequences (each 256 characters long) have been generated to evaluate the model. The first character has been chosen accordingly to a probability distribution based on the frequency of the characters in the original text.

The result is quite satisfying since, even though the examples have no actual meaning, at least most of the generated tokens are English words. Some examples are reported in the following pages; it can be seen that although without any sense, many of them still have some reasonable structure: take a look at the usage of quotation marks to enclose a direct speech, for example. However, some of the presented generation are really bad.

Please note that few newline characters have been removed for brevity's sake.
